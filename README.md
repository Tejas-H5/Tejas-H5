## Currently working on

- [App framwork](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/odin-app-framwork) - [Odin] - an app framwork that I started in C#, then moved to C for specific freetype bindings, then moved again to Odin because I didn't like the hashmap I wrote in C.

## Best projects so far
- [Macro Runner](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/MacroRunner) - [TypeScript, NodeJS] - A VSCode extension to run javascript scripts on the current file. The 'hard' part here is actually the API design, and not necessarily the code itself.
- [Powerslide](https://gamejolt.com/games/Powerslide/805966) - [Unity, C#] - An arcade racing game where all levels are made with a level editor that is available to the user from day 1. (I made it in unity, so it's future is uncertain.)
- [Interpreted Programming language*](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Calculator) - [Vanilla JavsScript] - A go-like toy language for quick floating-point calculations and graphing
- [Javascript Keyboard/Sequencer](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Javascript-Keyboard) - [Vanilla JavsScript] - a keyboard based virtual instrument. It can also play back note sequences, and has a feature that attempts to teach you how to play note sequences.
