## Web things I have worked on:

- [Chess HUD](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Chess-HUD)
  - An idea for a HUD while playing chess that can prevent one move blunders
- [Programming language / calculator](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Calculator)
  - An interpreted programming language created within an interpreted programming language. I would like 
- [Javascript-Keyboard](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Javascript-Keyboard)
  - A virtual instrument that I would like to slowly turn into a rhythm game
- [Minimal-JS-framework](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Minimal-JS-framework)
  - What I believe is a minimal set of helpers/primitives that can be used to make basically SPA. The description of SolidJS signals reminded me of plain old events from C#, so I wanted to try making a framework that used events as their reactivity primitive. I still need to make something medium-large sized with this to see if it is actually a good idea

## VSCode extensions I have worked on:

- [Macro Runner](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/MacroRunner)
  - A quick and easy way to run javascript on a file I have open, in order to edit/analyse it. I found myself copy-pasting files to a seperate folder for processing with a python script way too often, and this was a good way to put a stop to this

## (Windows) Desktop (C#, C++) things I have worked on:

- [Minimal Application Framework C#](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/CSharp-Minimal-Application-Framework)
  - I wanted to make a framework that would allow me to easily program whatever desktop apps I wanted to, but with a ProcessingJS-like API.
- [Minimal Application Framework C++](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/MinimalAF-CPP)
  - Same as above, but in C++. Probably because I wanted to see if it would be any faster. Also abandoned
- [Command line journalling program](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Rust-journal)
  - A journalling program written in Rust. Fairly small, involves file IO and dates. This project is not abandoned - it is finished. (JK, it's abandoned)
- [Non-grating timer](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Non-Grating-Timer)
  - A timer with a unique way of notifying the user that the time's up that does not use any audio

## Unity games I have worked on:

- [Racing Drift](https://gamejolt.com/games/RacingDrift/377289) [Private repo, also you probably really don't want to see the code on this one]
  - An arcade racing game with multiple cars and tracks, + the ability to load and save ghosts.
- [Harmonic Table](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Harmonic-Table)


TODO:
- add dates for these projects. Many of them are several years old by now
