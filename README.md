I can only pin 6 repos, which isn't enough imo. Programming is one of those things where quantity can be as important as quality.

## Currently working on

- [Powerslide](https://gamejolt.com/games/Powerslide/805966) - An arcade racing game where all levels are made with a level editor that is available to the user from day 1

## Small utilities

These are some of the simplest projects I have done programming-wise, but they are also the most useful in the work that they do.

- [FocusBalancer](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/FocusBalancer) - A python script that pauses your video/podcast/media when you have stopped typing/mouse-using, and resumes it when you start again. (TODO: report back here whether or not this actually works with preventing youtube videos from distracting me)

- [Non-grating timer](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Non-Grating-Timer) A C# WinForms timer program  that focuses itself and bounces around your window like the [DvD] screensaver we all know and love. It is designed to be extremely simple, and work without using any audio, so that it doesn't jumpscare me

- [CopyIfNewer](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/CopyIfNewer) A python script that copies newer files from a source directory to a destination directory. It's faster than copying every file, and more convenient than manually copying just the files that you have worked on/added.

- [Macro Runner](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/MacroRunner) - A VSCode extension for running arbitrary JavaScript code on a text file you have open. I really should have called it JavaScript runner, a big blunder on my part :(

## Web stuff

Messing around with html + JavaScript. Most of these have github-pages deployments that you can try out.

- [Interpreted Programming language*](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Calculator) - Initially practice for writing a parser, turned into a web-based calculator for prototyping math functions and algorithms. For extra fun, I coded it with vanilla JS...

- [Chess HUD](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Chess-HUD) - A Chess HUD to prevent one-move-blunders

- [Javascript Keyboard/Sequencer](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Javascript-Keyboard) - A virtual instrument prototype that fixes most issues that I had with the `Harmonic Table` project I mention later. It can be the foundation for a rhythm game, or a DAW that I intend to make in the future

- [Minimal-JS-framework](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Minimal-JS-framework) - I was consuming a lot of frontend web-dev content on youtube/twitter at the time, and it inspired me to make my own JS 'framework', but with the goal of being extremely minimal.

## C# stuff

It's mostly GameDev in Unity, as opposed to the MVC REST API stuff people really care about - I've done a bit of that too, but not in my spare time.

- [Minimal Application Framework C#](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/CSharp-Minimal-Application-Framework) A C# framework for making desktop apps with a Processing-like API, but with only what I need (The creative coding framework based in Java)

- Powerslide - An arcade racing game I am making in Unity, the successor to Racing Drift. TODO: add a link when once I release it

- [Racing Drift](https://gamejolt.com/games/RacingDrift/377289) - An arcade racing game with multiple cars and tracks, + the ability to load and save ghosts. Private repo, also you probably really don't want to see the code on this one

- [Harmonic Table](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Harmonic-Table) A virtual instrument using a harmonic table layout that I saw someone else make in a HackerNews post, that I wanted a playable version of. 

## Java/Processing stuff

They are all Processing sketches, but still very much Java nonetheless.
They are also very old, because I don't do much of anything in Processing anymore (Not that I have anything against Processing. I just haven't had the time).

- [OnesAndZeroes](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/OnesAndZeroes) - A logic gate simulator using a reverse-linked DAG type structure to propagate the signals. I manually rolled custom recursive serialization to save circuit layouts, because I didn't know what JSON was at the time :(

- [Sound-Painter](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Sound-Painter) - A sound designing program with the simplicity of Paint. It allows you to paint the waveform with brushes, but it is woefully ignorant of any actual sound design ideas, so it ended up being more of an experiment with UI

- [GOL Sandbox](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Game-of-life-sandbox) - Game of life, but you have 200 patterns that you can place anywhere on the grid. I ripped those patterns from someone else's GOL code tbh, but their project didn't allow me to place them wherever I wanted like you can in this one
