# WIP

- [Powerslide](https://gamejolt.com/games/Powerslide/805966) - [Unity, C#] - An arcare racing game loosely inspired by drifting anime and youtube videos. All tracks are made with the in-game level editor. The plan is to port it away from Unity.

# WIP/ shelved

- [Javascript Keyboard/Sequencer](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Javascript-Keyboard) - [Vanilla JavsScript] - a keyboard based virtual instrument. It can also play back note sequences, and has a feature that attempts to teach you how to play note sequences.
- [Osu cursor actuator](https://github.com/Tejas-H5/OsuRenderer) - If you know, you know
- [Chess 1 move blunder HUD](https://github.com/Tejas-H5/Chess-HUD) - a potential alternate UI layout that shows all the current threats in the position before/after a move.

## Completed, possibly with maintanence:

- [Note Tree](https://github.com/Tejas-H5/Working-on-Tree) - [TypeScript] - Web app, lets you write a series of tasks/notes in a tree structure, while recording the times at which you create and edit them. This allows for precise time tracking, if you remember to actually use it...
- [Macro Runner](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/MacroRunner) - [TypeScript, NodeJS] - VSCode extension, allows you to run arbitrary JavaScript code you just wrote to do string processing on the code you have open.
- [Programming language in the browser](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Calculator) - [Vanilla JavsScript] - A go-like toy language for quick floating-point calculations and graphing operations. Could be made to do a whole lot more.
- [App framwork](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/odin-app-framwork) - [Odin] - an app framwork that I started in C#, then moved to C for specific freetype bindings, then moved again to Odin because I didn't like the hashmap I wrote in C.
